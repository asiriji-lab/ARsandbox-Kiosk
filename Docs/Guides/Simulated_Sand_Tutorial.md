# Walkthrough: Simulated Sand Verification

**Objective**: Verify the "Virtual Sand" system is functioning correctly. This system allows us to test the projector and graphics without needing physical sand.

**Follow these steps exactly in order.**

### Step 1: Launch and Open Controls
1.  Run the application.
2.  If the menu is not visible, press **`Tab`** or the **`~` (Tilde)** key on your keyboard.
    *   *Check*: You should see the "SANDBOX COMMAND" panel on the left side of the screen.

### Step 2: Enable Simulation Mode
1.  Click on the **WORLD** tab at the top of the menu.
2.  Locate the **SIMULATION MODE** section (yellow header).
3.  Check the box for **Enable Virtual Sand**.
    *   *Check*: The screen should immediately show a 3D terrain. If it was black before, it should now be colorful.

### Step 3: Test Terrain Movement
1.  In the **WORLD** tab, find the slider labeled **Slide Speed**.
2.  Drag it to the right (around 1.0 - 2.0).
    *   *Check*: The terrain should start "flowing" or moving horizontally.
3.  Find the slider labeled **Terrain Chaos**.
    *   *Action*: Drag it back and forth.
    *   *Check*: The hills and valleys should change shape instantly (becoming smoother or more jagged).

### Step 4: Verify Graphis & Water
1.  Click on the **VIEW** tab at the top of the menu.
2.  **Water Test**:
    *   Find the **Water Level** slider.
    *   Drag it up and down.
    *   *Check*: Verify that blue water rises from the "floor" and floods the valleys.
3.  **Color Cycle**:
    *   Click the button **Cycle Color Scheme** (bottom of the list).
    *   *Action*: Click it 3-4 times.
    *   *Check*: Ensure the colors change to different themes (e.g., Red/Orange for Volcano, Blue/Green for Ocean).

### Step 5: Test Camera Controls
*Do this using the Keyboard arrow keys.*

1.  **Zoom Out**: Hold the **Down Arrow** key.
    *   *Check*: The camera should pull back, showing more of the map.
2.  **Zoom In**: Hold the **Up Arrow** key.
    *   *Check*: The camera should move closer.
3.  **Change Perspective**: Press the **Right Arrow** key once.
    *   *Check*: The view should switch to a 45-degree angle.
4.  **Profile View**: Press the **Right Arrow** key again.
    *   *Check*: The view should switch to a side view (good for checking height).
5.  **Reset**: Press **Right Arrow** one more time to return to Top-Down view.

### Step 6: Completion
1.  Navigate back to the **WORLD** tab.
2.  Uncheck **Enable Virtual Sand** to return to the sensor view.
3.  Press **`Tab`** to hide the menu.
